// Dijkstra's Algorithm
/* 

    What is it?
    - One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around!
    - Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph;
    - "What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?".


    The approach:
    - Every time we look to visit a new node, we pick the 
    node with the smallest known distance to visit first;
    - Once we’ve moved to the node we’re going to visit, we 
    look at each of its neighbors;
    - For each neighboring node, we calculate the distance by 
    summing the total edges that lead to the node we’re checking 
    from the starting node;
    - If the new total distance to a node is less than the 
    previous total, we store the new shorter distance for 
    that node.

    Pseudocode:
    - This function should accept a starting and ending vertex;
    - Create an object (we'll call it distances) and set each 
    key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value 
    of infinity, except for the starting vertex which should 
    have a value of 0;
    - After setting a value in the distances object, add each 
    vertex with a priority of Infinity to the priority queue, 
    except the starting vertex, which should have a priority 
    of 0 because that's where we begin;
    - Create another object called previous and set each key 
    to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of null;
    - Start looping as long as there is anything in the priority 
    queue:
        - dequeue a vertex from the priority queue;
        - If that vertex is the same as the ending vertex - we 
        are done!
        - Otherwise loop through each value in the adjacency list 
        at that vertex:
            - Calculate the distance to that vertex from the 
            starting vertex;
            - if the distance is less than what is currently 
            stored in our distances object;
                - update the distances object with new lower 
                distance;
                - update the previous object to contain that 
                vertex;
                - enqueue the vertex with the total distance 
                from the start node.
